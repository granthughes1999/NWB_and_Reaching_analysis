order of main files to run


1. create_new_mouse_folder.ipynb --> this needs to be run first for a new mouse. it duplicates all files in the master folder, creating a new folder here mice/mouse_id, you should work and modify these files for each mouse
> you just need to change the mouse_id = 'mouse_name'

-----------------------------------------------
ONLY procced to here if you have already run create_new_mouse_folder.ipynb
and only modify the files inside that specific mouses folder
you can make global changes to the files in the master folder, but then those will get duplicated into all new mice files

1. analyze_data/event_plots.ipynb --> allows you to make plots to see if Tones, optical pulses, and all events are correctly aligned. uses digital inputs from open-ephys to create plots

2. general_nwb_creation/pre_proccess_data_forNWB.ipynb --> This will create two .json files, df_stim.json with all of the timestamps for every event(T6000, T5000, stimROI...) aligned to neuropixel data. and the df_units.json, which holds all the information for every unit from every probe. both of these files gets saved to the intermediates folder here \\Record Node 103\\experiment1\\recording1\\continuous\\intermediates

3. general_nwb_creation/makeNWB.ipynb --> this takes the df_stim.json and df_units.json, and creates the final NWB

4. analyze_data/path_raster_NWB.ipynb --> this allows you to load in the NWB and make raster and PSTH plots for all the units and all the events

----------------------------------------------
Extra Code Packages

1. general_nwb_creation/manually_align_timestamps.ipynb --> this is for the instance when the timestamps.npy file is coruputed from open-ephys, this notebook allows you to re-create the timestamps.npy files.

2. analyze_data/viewNWB.ipynb --> this allows you to look at the NWB in-depth if you want
